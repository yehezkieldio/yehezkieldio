Hello! I am **Yehezkiel Dio** `/iˈziːkiel/`(also known as **Eliziel** or **Liz**)

I'm a software engineer based in Indonesia. I am passionate about building accessible and delightful digital experiences. I mostly work in full-stack web development, with a generalized focus on front-end, back-end, and devops technologies, though I don't consider myself an expert in any specific area.
